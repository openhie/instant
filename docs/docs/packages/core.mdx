:::info
The Instant OpenHIE architecture, codebase, and documentation are under active development and are subject to change. While we encourage adoption and extension of the Instant OpenHIE framework, we do not consider this ready for production use at this stage.
:::

The Instant OpenHIE Core Package is the common base of the Instant OpenHIE system and it provides fundamental components that other packages may build off of.

This package consists of two components that support all other packages, these are:

- An Interoperability Layer - [OpenHIM](http://openhim.org/)
- A FHIR Server - [HAPI FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/)

## Package functionality

This package sets up containers that support the OpenHIM as well as the HAPI FHIR server.
It also configures the OpenHIM with a *HAPI FHIR channel*. This allows authorised data transfer to the HAPI FHIR server through the OpenHIM.

An example of what the core package includes, as well as how a sample package (in this case the Health-Workforce package) may use the services the core package provides, is shown below.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Package architecture" src={useBaseUrl('img/instant-ohie-generic-arch.png')} />
</div>

To use the HAPI FHIR server from an external point of care application, you can access it through the OpenHIM at a URL like the following:

```bash
curl <openhim_core_transaction_api_url>/fhir/Patient
```

> The **openhim_core_transaction_api_url** is displayed in the output when starting up Instant OpenHIE

Accessing the services created by this package:
- **OpenHIM**
  - Console: Displayed in the output during startup
  - Username: **root@openhim.org**
  - Password: **instant101**
- **HAPI FHIR**
  - This service should not be publicly accessible and **only accessed via the Interoperability Layer**

## Deployment strategy

The OpenHIM was already dockerised so we were able to re-use those images for our work in the core package.
HAPI FHIR didn't have official dockerfiles available, however, several community contributed options existed. We chose to use what seemed like the most robust option.

We supplied Docker Compose files for the setup and configuration of these applications. We chose to split the `docker-compose.*.yml` files into three concerns:

1. **Main** `docker-compose.yml` file - sets up the base applications
1. **Config** `docker-compose.config.yml` file - configures the OpenHIM with a channel route to HAPI FHIR
1. **Dev** `docker-compose.dev.yml` file - exposes all open port to the host for easy debugging. This should not be used a production environment

For Kubernetes, we created deployment and service resource files for each component of each application.
The setup is orchestrated by a `kustomization.yml` file for easy deployment.
To import configuration into the OpenHIM, we use job resources that only execute when the OpenHIM core is up.
This is done with an `init container` which waits for the OpenHIM core port to become available.

For importing config, we use a custom image which is just a node.js container that can run node.js scripts that we define.
It also has a `wait-on` module installed to allow it to wait on certain ports being available before executing.

## Core Package Dev guide

For testing purposes, this package can be run independently. Below are some notes of how to do this.
The recommended way to run Instant OpenHIE is described [here](../introduction/getting-started.mdx).

Select a deployment target below and follow the getting started steps in setting up this package.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="dockerCompose"
  values={[
    { label: 'Docker Compose', value: 'dockerCompose' },
    { label: 'Kubernetes', value: 'kubernetes' }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="dockerCompose">

Before proceeding, ensure that you are in the directory (`core/docker/`) containing the `docker-compose` script.

From the working directory, execute our `docker-compose` script.
This will create all the services and print out their logs in the terminal.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### Useful compose flags

Some additional flags can be passed to the `docker-compose` command making it easier to work with.

- `-d`: Run the services in a detached mode. This means that when you close or exit your terminal, the services will still be running in the background.
- `-f`: Specify the location of the `docker-compose` file to be executed. Omitting this flag will look for the default `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `--force-recreate`: This will force the container/image to be re-created if a newer version is found. This is useful when a new image has been released but not yet pulled onto the host machine.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

#### Environment configuration

The default script might not suit the type of environment you want to run.
Therefore there are additional `docker-compose` files available for fine-tuning environment configuration.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Main `docker-compose` script to create the services
- **docker-compose.dev.yml**: Development `docker-compose` script to override some of the default configurations.

    > **Development environment only** as this exposes service ports.

##### Development configuration

Can specify three `docker-compose` files.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker-compose.config.yml up -d
```

##### Production-like configuration

Should use only two `docker-compose` files.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.config.yml up -d
```

<TabItem value="kubernetes">

> If you are working with multiple cluster hosting clients you may need to switch cluster context for your deployment. See the below commands:

```sh
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
```

#### Minikube (local)

For the Kubernetes deployment to work as expected, we need to ensure we have `minikube` installed on our local machine running the deployment.
Follow these steps to [install minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)

Once installed, we can start the minikube service by executing the below command:

```sh
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 8192
```

This also updates the VM settings to make use of 4 CPU's and 8GB of RAM, instead of the default 2 CPU's and 4GB of RAM

#### Getting Started

Useful Links:

- [Kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/cheatsheets/getting-started-with-kubernetes-a-kubectl-cheat-sheet)

Before we proceed with creating our `Core Package` services, we need to ensure we are in the correct directory containing our bash setup scripts.

Once you are in the correct working directory (`core/kubernetes`) we can proceed to create our core Instant OpenHIE deployment with the following command:

```bash
./main/k8s.sh up
```

The OpenHIM console url will be displayed in the terminal output when the script completes. The Url may take a few minutes to become active as the pod may not be fully initialized yet.

This bash script will apply the kubernetes `kustomization.yaml` file which controls the `Core Package` components (i.e. OpenHIM and HAPI-FHIR).

> On first run, the setup may take up to 10 minutes as the Docker images for each component will need to be pulled. This won't happen on future runs.

#### View running Kubernetes resources

Execute the below commands to see the running Kubernetes resources and the state that they are in.

To display all resource: (Some new resources are not listed here)

```sh
kubectl get all --all-namespaces
```

To tear down this deployment, use the opposing command:

```bash
./main/k8s.sh down
```

To completely remove all project components, use the following option:

```bash
./main/k8s.sh destroy
```

---

#### Initial OpenHIM Config

We have included a useful set of scripts to initialize the OpenHIM and set it up to communicate with the HAPI-FHIR server.
This will change the default user's password of the OpenHIM to `instant101`, and create a channel configured to route traffic to the HAPI-FHIR instance.
From the `kubernetes` directory, use the following command to implement:

```bash
./importer/k8s.sh up
```

> These scripts can be duplicated and modified to implement custom imports

To clean up the remaining job and pods from a successful setup, run the following:

```bash
./importer/k8s.sh clean
```

Once the config is done HAPI FHIR will be accessible on: <https://OPENHIM_CORE_HOSTNAME/fhir/>

You can test that the OpenHIM is routing requests to HAPI FHIR by running:

```bash
./test.sh <OPENHIM_CORE_HOSTNAME>
```

---

#### Development mode for exposed services

To run in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
./dev/k8s.dev.sh
```

> In this mode the OpenHIM mongo database, HAPI FHIR server, and the MySQL database can be accessed directly from their urls.
